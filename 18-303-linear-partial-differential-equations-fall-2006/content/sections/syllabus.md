Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Prerequisites
-------------

Differential Equations ([18.03](/courses/18-03-differential-equations-spring-2006) or [18.034](/courses/18-034-honors-differential-equations-spring-2004)). Complex Variables with Applications ([18.04](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-04-complex-variables-with-applications-spring-2018/)) or Functions of a Complex Variable ([18.112](/courses/18-112-functions-of-a-complex-variable-fall-2008)) are useful, as well as previous acquaintance with the equations as they arise in scientific applications.

Textbook
--------

Either one of the following textbooks will do.

Guenther, R. B., and J. W. Lee. _Partial Differential Equations of Mathematical Physics and Integral Equations_. New York, NY: Dover Publications, 1996. ISBN: 0486688895.

Myint-U, Tyn, and Lokenath Debnath. _Linear Partial Differential Equations for Scientists and Engineers._ 4th ed. Boston, MA: Birkhauser, 2006. ISBN: 0817643931.

Assignments and Exams
---------------------

There will be 6 problem sets given throughout the term. There will be two in-class tests and a final exam.
